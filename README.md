Hey there!
Thank you so much for checking out my Github.

You can check out the fully functioning app at http://www.swapmydosh.com/
Please know that it takes forever to load since it's running on the free Heroku version.
Also, to be able to use the apps full functionality, please sign up first.

We made this Rails app as our final project during Le Wagon's coding camp.
